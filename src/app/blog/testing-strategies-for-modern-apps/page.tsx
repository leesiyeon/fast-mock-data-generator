              Modern web applications are complex systems with multiple layers, integrations, and user interactions. A comprehensive testing strategy is essential to ensure quality, reliability, and maintainability. This guide explores various testing approaches and when to use each one.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">The Testing Pyramid</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              The testing pyramid is a framework that helps balance different types of tests. At the base are unit tests (fast, numerous), in the middle are integration tests (moderate speed and number), and at the top are end-to-end tests (slow, few). This distribution ensures fast feedback while maintaining comprehensive coverage.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Unit tests should form 70% of your tests, integration tests 20%, and end-to-end tests 10%. This ratio provides fast feedback during development while catching integration issues and user-facing bugs.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Unit Testing</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Unit tests validate individual components or functions in isolation. They run quickly, making them ideal for rapid feedback during development. Good unit tests are focused, independent, and test one thing at a time.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Write unit tests for business logic, utility functions, and complex algorithms. Mock external dependencies to keep tests fast and reliable. Use descriptive test names that explain what behavior is being validated.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Integration Testing</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Integration tests verify that different parts of your application work together correctly. They test interactions between components, database operations, API calls, and third-party services. Integration tests catch issues that unit tests miss, like incorrect API contracts or database query problems.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Use test databases and mock external services to keep integration tests fast and repeatable. Focus on critical user flows and common integration points. Reset test data between runs to ensure test independence.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">End-to-End Testing</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              E2E tests simulate real user interactions, testing your entire application stack from UI to database. They validate that critical user journeys work as expected. Tools like Cypress, Playwright, and Selenium enable automated browser testing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Keep E2E tests focused on happy paths and critical flows. They&apos;re slower and more brittle than other tests, so use them sparingly. Test registration, login, checkout, and other essential user journeys that would cause major issues if broken.
            </p>

          <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Test Data Management</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Effective test data management is crucial for reliable tests. Generate fresh, realistic mock data for each test run. Use data builders or factories to create test objects consistently. Avoid shared mutable state that can cause test interference.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Mock data generators help create diverse test scenarios quickly. Generate edge cases, boundary values, and realistic data variations. This approach improves test coverage and catches bugs that only appear with specific data patterns.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Continuous Integration</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Integrate tests into your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early. Run unit tests on every commit, integration tests on pull requests, and E2E tests before deployment. Fast feedback loops help developers fix issues while code is fresh in their minds.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Parallel test execution speeds up CI runs. Fail fast by running quick tests first. Monitor test trends to identify flaky tests and address them promptly. Reliable CI builds confidence in your deployment process.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Performance Testing</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Performance tests ensure your application handles expected load. Use load testing tools to simulate multiple concurrent users. Monitor response times, throughput, and error rates under stress. Identify bottlenecks before they impact users.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Set performance budgets and alert when thresholds are exceeded. Test with realistic data volumes and usage patterns. Performance testing catches issues like N+1 queries, memory leaks, and scalability problems.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Test Maintenance</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Tests require maintenance just like production code. Refactor tests when they become hard to understand. Remove duplicate test logic. Update tests when requirements change. Well-maintained tests provide long-term value.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Review test failures promptly. Fix flaky tests immediately—they erode confidence in your test suite. Document complex test scenarios. Treat test code with the same care as production code.
            </p>
