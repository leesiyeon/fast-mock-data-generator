            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              API testing is a critical component of modern software development. Unlike UI testing, which can be brittle and slow, API testing provides fast, reliable feedback about your application's core functionality. Whether you're building a REST API, GraphQL endpoint, or microservices architecture, following these best practices will help you create robust, maintainable tests.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">1. Use Realistic Mock Data</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              One of the most common mistakes in API testing is using overly simplified test data. While it may be tempting to use easy values like "test@test.com" or "John Doe," this approach can hide bugs that only surface with real-world data variations.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Instead, generate realistic mock data that includes edge cases: long names, special characters, international addresses, and various date formats. This approach helps ensure your API handles diverse input correctly and your validation logic is robust.
            </p>
            <div className="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p className="text-sm text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use mock data generators to create varied test scenarios automatically, saving time and improving test coverage.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">2. Test Response Status Codes</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              HTTP status codes communicate the outcome of API requests. Your tests should verify that your API returns appropriate codes for different scenarios: 200 for success, 201 for created resources, 400 for bad requests, 401 for unauthorized access, 404 for not found, and 500 for server errors.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Don't just test the happy path. Create tests for error scenarios to ensure your API provides meaningful status codes that help clients handle failures gracefully. This is especially important for public APIs where you have little control over how clients will use your endpoints.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">3. Validate Response Schema</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Beyond checking status codes, verify that response bodies match expected schemas. This ensures your API contracts remain stable as code evolves. Use JSON Schema validation or similar tools to define expected response structures.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Schema validation catches issues like missing fields, incorrect data types, or unexpected null values before they reach production. This is particularly valuable in microservices architectures where multiple services depend on consistent API contracts.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">4. Test Authentication and Authorization</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Security testing is non-negotiable. Verify that protected endpoints reject unauthorized requests and that authentication tokens work correctly. Test different permission levels to ensure users can only access resources they're authorized for.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Common scenarios to test include expired tokens, invalid credentials, missing authentication headers, and permission boundaries. Don't forget to test that sensitive data is properly masked or excluded from responses for users without appropriate permissions.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">5. Implement Proper Test Data Management</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Test data management is often overlooked but critical for reliable testing. Create fresh test data for each test run to avoid dependencies between tests. This isolation prevents flaky tests where one test's side effects impact another.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Use database transactions or cleanup scripts to restore test environments to known states. Consider using test databases that are separate from development environments to prevent accidental data corruption.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">6. Test Performance and Response Times</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              APIs should respond quickly to provide good user experience. Include performance assertions in your tests to catch performance regressions early. Set reasonable thresholds based on your SLAs and alert when APIs exceed them.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Test how your API performs under load. Use load testing tools to simulate multiple concurrent users and identify bottlenecks before they impact production. Monitor response times, throughput, and error rates under stress.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">7. Cover Edge Cases and Error Handling</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Most bugs lurk in edge cases. Test boundary values, null inputs, empty strings, extremely long strings, special characters, and malformed requests. Verify that your API handles these gracefully with appropriate error messages.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Good error handling means providing clear, actionable error messages that help clients understand what went wrong and how to fix it. Test that error responses include helpful details without exposing sensitive system information.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">8. Automate Your Tests</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Manual API testing is time-consuming and error-prone. Automate your tests and integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline. This ensures every code change is validated automatically before deployment.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Automated tests provide fast feedback during development, catch regressions immediately, and give teams confidence to refactor and deploy frequently. Use tools like Jest, Mocha, or pytest depending on your stack.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">9. Version Your APIs Properly</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              APIs evolve over time, but breaking changes can disrupt clients. Use versioning to maintain backward compatibility. Test that old API versions continue working while new versions introduce improvements.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Maintain test suites for each API version to prevent regressions in older versions. This is especially important for public APIs where you may need to support multiple versions simultaneously.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">10. Document Your Tests</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Well-documented tests serve as living documentation for your API. Use descriptive test names that explain what behavior is being verified. Include comments explaining complex test scenarios or business logic.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Good test documentation helps new team members understand API behavior quickly and makes it easier to maintain tests as requirements change. Consider using tools that generate API documentation from test cases.
            </p>
